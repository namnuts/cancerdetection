After performing the pre-processing techniques on the provided dataset i.e Cancer detection,below are the findings from the exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

1.Out of the all observations , 37.3% of them were diagnosed to be malignant (risky)and 62.7% of them were benign.(almost out of danger) 
 
   > Approximately 212 of them were in the Risky stage.

2. Out of all, 25th percentile of them in Malignant are having the area mean just below 1000, whereas for benign it falls under 500.

3. While observing scatter plot between the Radius mean and texture mean by diagnosis, we can understand that ‘M’ observations are more widely spread out and most of the observations are even falling into the cluster of ‘B’ , while having the capacity to become potential outliers.

4.All the radius,texture,perimeter and area mean were more incase of ‘B’ rather than ‘M’ by observing area plots.

5. In the cluster map, ‘B’ points are more scattered in the perimeter_mean v/s texture than ‘M’.

6. Incase of texture_mean v/s area_mean the scattering is less for ‘B’ thus by reducing the scope of outliers
